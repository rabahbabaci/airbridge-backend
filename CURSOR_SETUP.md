# Cursor Setup (No-Code Phase)

## Open Project
- File → Open Folder → `airbridge-backend`

## Recommended First Reads
1. `README.md`
2. `docs/product/requirements.md`
3. `docs/api/contracts.md`
4. `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`

## First Implementation Prompt (when coding starts)
"Create a FastAPI project skeleton in `src/` that implements only health and version endpoints, using the API documentation in this repo. Do not add integrations yet."

## Working Rules
- Keep implementation aligned with contracts in `docs/api/contracts.md`
- Avoid adding new scope not listed in `docs/product/out-of-scope.md`
- Keep changes small and reviewable
